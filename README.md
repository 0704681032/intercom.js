### Cross-Window Broadcast Interface

Intercom is a client-side library that broadcasts messages to all of a user's open windows / tabs (open to your site, of course). A [socket.io binding](#using-with-socketio) is built inâ€”which allows a single socket connection to painlessly propagate messages to all windows.

The service is built on top of the [HTML5 sessionStorage API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#the-sessionstorage-attribute).

## Usage

```javascript
var intercom = new Intercom();

intercom.on('notice', function(data) {
	console.log(data.message);
});

intercom.emit('notice', {message: 'Hello, all windows!'});
```

### Using with Socket.io

With the [socket.io](http://socket.io/) binding it's easy set up the socket connection to broadcast messages it recieves to all open windows. Similarly, it's effortless to send messages over the single active socket from any open window (simply by calling `emit` on intercom).

```javascript
intercom.bind(socket);
```

If you wish to override the default behavior to control whether the socket should be treated as read-only or write-only, use:

```javascript
intercom.bind(socket, {
	transmit : false, // send messages emitted on intercom over the socket
	recieve  : true   // broadcast messages from the socket
});
```
